# Awesome list of chemometrics tools

## Python

* [chemotools](https://github.com/paucablop/chemotools) - a Python package that integrates chemometrics with Scikit-learn
* [rampy](https://github.com/charlesll/rampy) - Rampy is a Python library that aims at helping processing spectroscopic data, such as Raman, Infrared or XAS spectra
* [chemometrics](https://github.com/maruedt/chemometrics) - Python library for chemometric data analysis
* [spectrapepper](https://github.com/spectrapepper/spectrapepper) - A Python package for advanced processing and combinatorial analysis of spectroscopy data
* [pybaselines](https://github.com/derb12/pybaselines) - A Python library of algorithms for the baseline correction of experimental data
* [pyspc-unmix](https://github.com/r-hyperspec/pyspc-unmix) - Python package for unmixing hyperspectral data
* [PySptools](https://pysptools.sourceforge.io) - PySptools. Tools for hyperspectral imaging

## R

* [hyperSpec](https://github.com/r-hyperspec/hyperSpec) - The goal of hyperSpec (and whole r-hyperspec) is to make the work with hyperspectral data sets, (i.e. spatially or time-resolved spectra, or spectra with any other kind of information associated with each of the spectra) more comfortable. The spectra can be data as obtained during XRF, UV/VIS, Fluorescence, AES, NIR, IR, Raman, NMR, MS, etc. spectroscopy measurements.
* [baseline](https://github.com/khliland/baseline) - R package 'baseline'. Baseline Correction of Spectra
* [mdatools](https://github.com/svkucheryavski/mdatools) - R package for Multivariate Data Analysis
* [unmixR](https://github.com/r-hyperspec/unmixR) - R package for unmixing hyperspectral data
